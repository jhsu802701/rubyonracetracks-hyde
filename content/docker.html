<h2>64-Bit vs. 32-Bit</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Don't try to mix-and-match 32-bit and 64-bit systems.  Use a 64-bit host OS and 64-bit Docker images, or use a 32-bit host OS and 32-bit Docker images.
	</li>
	<li>I recommend the use of a 64-bit host OS and 64-bit Docker images.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Tools like Kitematic, Docker Machine, and Docker Hub's automated builds are built for 64-bit users.  For example, I found that Docker Hub's automated build was unable to install Chef on a 32-bit system, because it insisted on trying to install the 64-bit version.</li>
			<li>Some projects use software that is only available for 64-bit systems.  For example, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org">rubygems.org</a> uses toxiproxy, which is not available for 32-bit systems.</li>
			<li>Don't use a 32-bit Docker image on a 64-bit system.  I found that PostgreSQL in my 32-bit Docker images did not work on my 64-bit Mac.  I also found that tmux in my 32-bit Docker images did not work in 64-bit Linux on my desktop PC.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>
		If your host machine does not support 64-bit hosts, or if the processor in your host machine does not support the VT-x or AMD-V standards for virtualization, then you should only use a 32-bit host OS and 32-bit Docker images on that machine.
	</li>
</ul>
