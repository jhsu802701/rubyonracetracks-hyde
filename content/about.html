About
=====

Ruby on Racetracks is a group of methods and procedures used to start Ruby on Rails projects much more quickly.  The stock procedures are slow to implement, and Ruby on Rails can be so finicky that just starting a project can feel like getting the planets to align.  Ruby on Racetracks doubles down on the shortcuts, automation, sanity checks, quality control, and other tools needed to streamline the process of working on a Ruby on Rails project.
