<h1>Model-View-Controller</h1>
The Model-View-Controller architecture is the basis for the Ruby on Rails web framework.  I found understanding MVC to be the most difficult part of understanding Ruby on Rails, but it is of critical importance.  You don't need a good understanding of MVC to get through Rails Tutorial, but you cannot be productive at working on Rails projects without it.  Be prepared to obsess over MVC, but you should obsess over it efficiently.
