<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

You should be familiar with Ruby and Rails.  You should learn Ruby first, because Rails won't make sense without at least a passing knowledge of Ruby.  If you try to learn Rails without being familiar with Ruby, it will feel like mysterious black magic and will be difficult to make sense of.
